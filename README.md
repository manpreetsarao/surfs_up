using slack and sqlite
## Overview of analysis
In this module we analyzed the weather data of Oahu. We analyzed this data to help an investor, who is interested in investing in our surf nâ€™ shake shop in Oahu. To analyze this data, we used SQLite which is a local database, SQLAlchemy and Flask to create web applications.
First step in our analysis is to analyze the precipitation of a full year of data from 23-08-2016 to 23-08-2017.  For more elaborate analysis, we used statistical representations. For detailed analysis we also collect the data about number of stations involved in our data collection and most active station. Based on active station, we analyzed the temperature data. To represent our data on web, we used flask. To get more depth in analysis, we analyzed the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. So that, the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
## Results
-	As from image we can see that count of dataset is different as we have total 1700 observations for June month and 1517 observations for the month of December. 
-	From second observation in our results, we can see that is a very less difference between the average, standard deviation, percentiles and maximum temperature. 
-	But there is larger difference between the minimum temperature of two months.

## Summary
From results, we can observe that Oahu is a good place. As it has good temperature for Ice cream and surfing for year around. Its temperature is around 56 to 85 during the whole year, which is the best thing, not too high and not too low. To more elaborate our research, we can add following two queries:
-	We can also add the query of precipitation for more details.
-	We can add another query for temperature of the Christmas week in December.
